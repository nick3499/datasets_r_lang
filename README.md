## Plotting Datasets Using R Programming Language

A _Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device_ was used to monitor air quality over time in an Italian city. The dataset listed readings of various sensors. By plotting data from the two CO sensors, I determined a correlation between the sensors.

In the CO sensor columns, there was also times when _[e]vidences of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts_ caused erroneous data. 

During a 24 span, CO concentration ranged from 1ppm to 7ppm.
